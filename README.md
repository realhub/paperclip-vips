# paperclip-vips

A custom paperclip processor that uses the [libvips image processing library](https://libvips.github.io/libvips) for faster image resizing and manipulation.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'paperclip-vips', :git=>'https://github.com/tsu-social/paperclip-vips.git'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install paperclip-vips

Note: You will need to have libvips installed on your machine for this processor to work correctly.

## Usage

Basic Example:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_attached_file :avatar,
    styles: {
        medium: { geometry: '300x300' },
        thumb: { geometry: '100x100#' }
    },
    processors: [:vips]
end
```

You can also provide additional processing steps by passing a json array to paperclip convert_options:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_attached_file :avatar,
    styles: {
        medium: { geometry: '300x300' },
        thumb: { geometry: '100x100#' }
    },
    :convert_options => {
        :cmyk_original => lambda { |file| [{
            cmd: "icc_transform",
            args: ["PATH_TO_PROFILE"],
            optional: {
                input_profile: "PATH_TO_INPUT_PROFILE",
                intent: :perceptual,
            },
        }].to_json }
    },
    processors: [:vips]
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
